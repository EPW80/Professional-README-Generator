# Professional README Generator

This back-end application utilizes the npm package, Inquirer.js, to generate a professional README.md file for your project. With this README generator, creating a README from scratch is unnecessary. Instead, you will answer a few prompted questions, and a complete README file will be produced instantaneously.

## Installation:

To get started with the Professional README Generator, follow these steps:

- Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
- Make sure that Node.js is installed on your machine. If it's not, you can download it from the official Node.js website.
- Ensure that Inquirer is installed. If not, you can install it by running npm install inquirer in your terminal.

## Usage:

Here are the steps to generate your README:

- Open your terminal or command line interface.
- Navigate to the directory containing the README Generator.
- Type node index.js and hit Enter.
- Answer the prompts that follow. These will include information about your project, like the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions.
- Upon successfully answering all the prompts, a README.md file will be generated in your current directory.
